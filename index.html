        <div id="container">

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td><img src="carp/CARP final.jpg" class="carp-img" alt="Final CARP design"
                            style="width:450px;height:650px;"></td>

                        <h4 div class="h4">My final CARP design</h4>

                        <p class="p5">For my final design I wanted to incorporate the 3 trialled designs. I used the
                            purple boxes in
                            order to create a frame around the image, leaving a white border surrounding the edges
                            to
                            contrast with the purple. I wanted to still be able to see the image beneath the purple
                            boxes,
                            so I lowered the opacity so it’s just visible.</p>

                        <p class="p5">I chose to use the image of the balloon with the sky as it contrasts with the
                            purple boxes.
                            Furthermore, I believe this image to be the most alluring as well as keeping the
                            intentions
                            clear to the reader. I only used one image as I didn’t want the poster to be
                            overcrowded.</p>

                        <p class="p5">With the logos, I removed the coloured background and placed it against the
                            image. I wanted the
                            logos to be subtle as not to distract from the typography and main image. For the logo
                            for the
                            event, I placed it in the bottom right corner and enlarged it so that it’s obvious to
                            the
                            reader. I also wanted it to act as a title.</p>

                        <p class="p5">For the typography I chose a sans-serif typeface for the main information; the
                            date, time and
                            information about price. I did this because the event isn’t ‘formal’. For the other text
                            I used
                            a serif typeface as a contrasting feature. For alignment I used a central alignment on
                            the
                            bottom of the poster and made the size smaller as it’s not as important. I placed the
                            date and
                            time on the banner and enlarged it so that it became an eye grabbing feature.
                            Furthermore I used
                            a white colour for the text as it contrasts with the colours of the image and purple
                            boxes, as
                            well as giving the poster a light feel.</p>

            <h2>Reflection Essay</h2>

            <p class="pRef">Before joining university and starting the course, I had no previous experience with any form of coding.
                However, having studied fine art and media studies at A level, I had some experience with the use of
                graphics. I used Adobe software (InDesign and Photoshop) during my studies. Due to this, I had
                previously learnt about the colour wheel, contrast and typography and other aspects, which I was able to
                put to use in this assignment. </p>
            <p class="pRef"> I started my assignment by completing the typographic systems posters. I enjoyed this task, as from
                getting the brief and learning about the 8 typographic systems, I automatically knew what I wanted to
                present within my designs. Despite this, I found it hard to create an effective design with the use of
                only one font and colour. I overcame this by utilising a monochromatic colour scheme and various font
                weights, to result in a clear and aesthetically pleasing design. </p>
            <p class="pRef">Whilst at first I struggled with the CARP task, I enjoyed having creative freedom, which allowed me to
                create a unique design. However, as the brief wasn’t too specific it took me a while to draft designs
                that I was happy with. As I wasn’t familiar with the event, I didn’t know whether to design a relaxed or
                formal poster. In the end I decided to use a sans serif font, along with a light colour in order to
                build a series of informal posters. </p>
            <p class="pRef">Due to the fact that I hadn’t used HTML or CSS before, I was slightly worried that I would struggle to
                complete this part of the task, as well as the final website. When I started the HTML worksheets, I
                found it easier than expected as the instructions were clear and easy for me to understand. I also
                completed the optional carousel task as I wanted to use this in my final website to showcase my
                typography systems on the homepage. </p>
            <p class="pRef">For the UX task I decided to use a miro board. I had never used this before starting the module, but I
                found it helpful when collaborating with peers as well as for my own work. I used wireframing as a rough
                guide for each of my pages, keeping the header and footer the same throughout. I didn’t want to have a
                single-scrolling website, as I believe it would make the website too long. I was also able to show more
                skills by creating multiple pages. </p>
            <p class="pRef">Overall, I have enjoyed this module and the assignment tasks as it has included a variety of projects. I
                was worried that I might struggle with the HTML and CSS side, however I believe that I have executed the
                assignment well, keeping my work minimal but still effective. </p>
